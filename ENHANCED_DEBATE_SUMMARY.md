        # Clear previous state and start fresh
        self.debate_history = []
        self.current_debate_id = f"debate_{int(time.time())}"
        # ... (tracks current debate only)

    def create_summary_prompt(self, topic, all_arguments):
        # Enhanced prompt with voting analysis and winner determination
